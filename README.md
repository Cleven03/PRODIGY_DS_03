# PRODIGY_DS_03
I am an Intern in Prodigy InfoTech and i have copmleted the task using google colab  in 13 -15 days. 

Task 1 :Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Task Overview
Obtain Dataset
- Use a dataset like Bank Marketing from UCI ML Repository
- Contains customer demographic/behavioral data and whether they purchased a term deposit
Preprocess Data
- Handle missing values 
- Encode categorical features numerically if needed
  Split into training and testing sets
 Train Decision Tree
- Import DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn.tree
- Set hyperparameters like max_depth, min_samples_split to control overfitting
- Fit the classifier to training data
Evaluate Model
- Make predictions on test set
- Calculate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Visualize decision tree to interpret important features
Optimize Model
- Try different hyperparameter values to improve performance
- Use techniques like pruning to reduce overfitting
- Perform feature selection to identify best predictors
Make Predictions
- Use trained model to predict if new customers will purchase
- Model outputs binary prediction (yes/no) based on attributes

  ## Dataset
The Dataset used for this task is bank-additional.csv from archive.ics.uci.edu

## Conclusion
 Properly preprocessing the data, training the model, evaluating its performance, and optimizing hyperparameters to build an effective decision tree classifier to predict whether customers will purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data
